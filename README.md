This project is a responsive webpage that  fetches current news article
(abstracts), URL's and related images from the New York Times API and appends 
it on the webpage. It's fully compatible for mobile, tablet and desktop
and delivers a preloader to give user's a visual on loading to clarify its
loading appropriately.

<!--------------TECHNOLOGIES AND STYLES USED-------------->
This project a handful technology I used was Gulp. Gulp is a node module
task runner that allowed me to work on my project without disrupting my 
developement work flow. I was allowed to save without having to manually refreshing the page as well. Gulp
was really helpful in minifying my project and getting rid of all the excessive
white space. I was able to set rules in my code and Gulp reminded me if any 
rules were being broken. As for errors, it gave me information on how and 
where the error occured. A type of style I used to handle my CSS files was 
putting elements in partials. Partials kept my code organized, and easy to
navigate through. Using SASS helped with my @mediaqueries alot, it gave me
the option to put breakpoints under the element I'm styling and I wasn't forced
to go back and forth.
